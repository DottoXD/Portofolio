## Self hosting
First of all you have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - i recommend NodeJS 18.
After that install the project's dependencies using the following command:
```bash
npm  i
```
You can then build the project & start hosting it at port 3000 using the following commands:
```bash
npm build
cd out
npx serve
```
You can alternatively use any static host such as [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
